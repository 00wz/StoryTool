# StoryTool Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for StoryTool.

## Planned Features

### Generic Triggers for Data Passing
- **Generic versions of `StartTrigger` and `EndTrigger`** to support data passing between events
- Allow events to send and receive typed data through the graph connections
- Maintain type safety while enabling flexible event communication

### Hierarchical Events
- **Nested graph support** - Events whose nodes will have a button that opens a nested graph
- Ability to create sub-graphs that can be edited and executed within parent events
- Visual indication of hierarchical relationships in the graph editor
- Support for multiple levels of nesting

### Node Operations
- **Copy/Duplicate/Paste functionality** for nodes
- Ability to copy nodes with all their properties and connections
- Duplicate selected nodes within the same graph
- Paste nodes from clipboard with automatic connection preservation
- Support for copying nodes between different graph instances
